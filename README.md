# ECE50024 Project: Plug-and-Play ADMM for Image Restoration: Fixed Point Convergence and Applications

This repository is our project of ECE50024 Machine Learning. Our project is about the reimplementation and exploration of Chan et al.'s [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01710).

## Instructions
`Checkpoint3.ipynb` is the code of checkpoint3 (reimplementation on a toy problem).
`final_checkpoint.ipynb` is our final code.
`train_metrics.zip` contains the training data while our model is being trained.
`validation_run_metrics.zip` contains the graphs and the results of the original, noised, and denoised images.
